# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated!

Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Types of Contributions

### Bug Reports, Feature Requests, and Feedback

Create a [new project issue][1]! Try to be as descriptive as possible.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:
* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Bug Fixes, New Features and Documentation

Create a [new merge/pull request][2]! Make sure to follow the guidelines.

Look through the GitHub issues for features, bugs and other requests.
Anything tagged with "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

## Merge/Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:
1. Make sure to have atomic commits and contextual commit messages!
  [Check out this awesome blog post by Chris Beams for more information.][3]
2. The pull request should include tests.
3. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated:
  1. Put your new functionality into a function with a docstring
  2. Add the feature to the list in README.md.
4. The pull request should work for Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 and for PyPy.
  [Check Travis-CI][4] and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
